# StateMachineExample
A basic example of a state machine to be used in a Unity project

Use a state machine instead of multiple IEnumerators in Unity classes

A state machine consists of basic interface states, accessed from a state machine class which is initialised from a Monobehaviour inheriting manager class. The example shows this by using an example game manager class that uses states to additively load async a scene and then run it. The example will not run as is if dropped into a new Unity project, it has been created as a public reference

This example can be expanded, I have put improvement comments to give an idea of some of the changes I have done for commercial projects
